- The number of bookings at 'City Hotel' type hotels is always more than 'Resort Hotels' every month.
- During the school holiday season (June - July) the number of hotel bookings increases, especially for 'City' type hotels which have the highest number of bookings. While for the 'Resort' type, the most bookings were in October.
- During the year-end holidays, there was also an increase in the number of orders, but not as much as during the mid-year holidays.
- The number of bookings outside of holidays is always not as much as during holidays, especially in March which reached the lowest point in average bookings in a matter of months.

- The longer the booking duration, the higher the cancellation ratio for 'City' type hotels.
- For hotels of the 'resort' type, the cancellation ratio tends to be the same, regardless of the duration of the booking.
- Overall, the cancellation ratio for 'City' hotels is higher than 'Resort' hotels.

- The longer the order time, the greater the possibility of order cancellation.
- The 'resort' type of hotel has a smaller order cancellation ratio than the 'city' hotel.
- 'Resort hotels' have the highest cancellation risk in monthly time intervals, but over longer periods the trend of order cancellations decreases.
